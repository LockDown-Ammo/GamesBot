This is a private discord bot used in specefic private servers to play games. Its not meant for public use and likely has many bugs and will crash easily. This has been coded as a passion and the code is not open to be used for commercial purposes (we ignore the fact that it can be viewed publicly)

The following games are listed below along with their descriptions.

## <a name="flood-game">Flood Game</a>

In this game you start with a random coloured board. Consider the top-left square colour as your home colour. Your first move should be to select a colour of its surrounding to turn your home square into that colour. Now the squares of that specefic colours joined to your home square all become individual home squares. Keep repeating this till the entire board is yout home square or of the same colour! Sounds confusing at frst but if u play a few times you will understand :D

Enjoy the game !!!

## <a name="connect-4">Connect 4</a>

This is a very old and classic game and most of the people should already know about it. Still for those who dont know.You start off with a blank gameboard. You can have either red or yellow colour. The main objective is to make a series of atleast 4 dots of the same colour in any direction (up, down, left, right and diagonals) First player to acheive this wins.

Enjoy the game !!!

## <a name="break-lock">Break Lock</a>

This is a very ( and not so very on basis of graphics xD ) modern pin cracking game. You start off with a classic 9 digit pin pad. The pin is 4 characters long. If you enter the correct pin , you win. Dont worry! It is not just about guess work. If you enter a wrong pin, it will give you hints in the form of circles:
> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/White_Circle.svg/2048px-White_Circle.svg.png" width="20" height="20" alt="[Solid filled white circle image]">  indicates that a digit is present in the pin and is at its correct position

Find out if you can crack the pin in under 20 tries!! Enjoy :D

## <a name="2048">2048</a>

This is a very classic game and you should know how to play it. For those who dont know you have to use the buttons to move the tile in one direction. If two tiles with same number collide they add up. The aim of the game is to get the 2048 tile.

Are you smart enough to complete it? Check it out!!

## <a name="hangman">Hangman</a>

Its a very nerdy game. The bot picks up a random word which you need to guess. You just need to guess what letters are there in the word. If the letter you guessed is correct then it will show u at what position the letter is appearing. Now using this you need to guess others also in the same way. However if you guessed an incorrect letter, a picture of a hanging man will start to form. Every wrong guess a new part of the hanging man will appear (Total 5 parts). If the picture gets completed you loose. If you complete the word then you win.
To guess a letter u need to react with an emoji of that letter in the game message.

Have fun :D

This section is for developers only and / or for the common pea sized public who considers themselves as developer even when they know nothing ( like me :D )

## <a name="project-progression-status">Project Progression Status</a>

> Progression Rate: Very Slow

I am lazy and I am a student... Do not expect frequent updates

You can tell how lazy I am by the fact that I am using markdown files to generate this (for ppl who are viewing this on docs website not github)...

## <a name="languages-and-frameworks">Languages and Frameworks</a>

> Runtime environment: Node JS

```Javascript``` has been used to make the server where it generates dynamic images from URL parameters.

```Typescript``` has been used to make the main discord bot and the docs that you are currently veiwing.

## <a name="dependencies">Dependencies</a>

Since both the bot and server were built using ```NodeJS``` npm packages were used.

For server:

- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas)
- [fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs)

For bot:

- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it)
  <!-- - [generate-github-markdown-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-github-markdown-css) -->
- [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
- [@discordjs/builders](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/builders)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs)
